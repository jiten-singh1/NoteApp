**MVVM with Clean-architecture:**  For small projects, MVVM is sufficient, but as your codebase grows more extensive, your ViewModels begin to bloat. It becomes challenging to separate responsibilities. In such instances, MVVM with Clean Architecture is a suitable choice. It goes a step further in segregating your code baseâ€™s responsibilities. The logic of the actions that can be performed in your app is abstracted.
